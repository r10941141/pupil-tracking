This is our final project for the Computer Vision course. Since the project is quite extensive, we created a separate repository to upload everything. It was also a good chance to refactor and modularize the code we wrote earlier, making it easier to maintain and expand in the future.

The main goal of this project is Pupil Tracking and Segmentation. We use a CNN-based architecture combined with image preprocessing and postprocessing techniques to improve the accuracy and robustness of the model.
